= Command line options =

== --help (-h) ==
Shows the options

== --input (-i) ==
Set the input file

== --output (-o) ==
Set the output file. If not given, the same name as the input is used, with the extension replaced with .h

== --debug (-d) ==
Enable output to std::clog, when a transition is made and when states are entered/exited.

== --baremetal (-b) ==
This option will prevent scxmlcc to generate dependencies to STL or RTTI, so the state machine can compile on tiny embedded systems where this is unwanted or not possible.

This gives some limitations:
  * The event queue is removed because it uses std::queue. This is normally used when sending events from actions.
  * Hierarchical and parallel state machines is not supported, since it uses RTTI
  * The --debug (-d) option is not supported, since it uses std::iostream

The two items could properly be implemented without using RTTI and STL, if requested.
